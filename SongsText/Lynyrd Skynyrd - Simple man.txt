Lynyrd Skynyrd,Simple man
Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this it'll help you
Some sunny day oh yeah

Oh take your time don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
Go find a woman yeah and you'll find love
And don't forget son there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son if you can

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this oh babe if you try
All that I want for you my son is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son if you can
Oh yes I will

Oh don't you worry you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this oh babe if you try
All that I want for you my son is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son if you can

And baby be a simple real simple man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
